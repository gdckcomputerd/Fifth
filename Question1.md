## Q1. Define Linux, its structure ,components and features of Linux
### Linux
Linux is one of popular version of UNIX operating System. It is open source as its source 
code is freely available. It is free to use. Linux was designed considering UNIX 
compatibility. Its functionality list is quite similar to that of UNIX.

### Structure




### Components of Linux
Linux Operating System has primarily three components
 1.   Kernel − Kernel is the core part of Linux. It is responsible for all major activities of 
this operating system. It consists of various modules and it interacts directly with the 
underlying hardware. Kernel provides the required abstraction to hide low level 
hardware details to system or application programs.
1. System Library − System libraries are special functions or programs using which 
application programs or system utilities accesses Kernel's features. These libraries 
implement most of the functionalities of the operating system and do not require
kernel module's code access rights.
1. System Utility − System Utility programs are responsible to do specialized, individual 
level tasks.

### Features of Linux

Following are some of the important features of Linux Operating System.
1. Portable − Portability means software can works on different types of hardware in 
same way. Linux kernel and application programs supports their installation on any 
kind of hardware platform.
2. Open Source − Linux source code is freely available and it is community based 
development project. Multiple teams work in collaboration to enhance the capability 
of Linux operating system and it is continuously evolving.
3. Multi-User − Linux is a multiuser system means multiple users can access system 
resources like memory/ ram/ application programs at same time.
4. Multiprogramming − Linux is a multiprogramming system means multiple 
applications can run at same time.
5. Hierarchical File System − Linux provides a standard file structure in which system 
files/ user files are arranged.
6. Shell − Linux provides a special interpreter program which can be used to execute 
commands of the operating system. It can be used to do various types of operations, 
call application programs. etc.
7. Security − Linux provides user security using authentication features like password 
protection/ controlled access to specific files/ encryption of data.
